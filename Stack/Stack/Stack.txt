What is a stack?
A stack is a complete data collection of items that is frozen in a way that allows items to be added and removed from only one end, this end is called the top. The stack can be likened to a wireless electronics stack where you can add new software or remove just clicks.

Harvesting gains:
LIFO (last in, first out): The last item popped onto the stack is the first item popped. This is the basic property of the stack.
Basic operations:
Push: Add an item to the top of the material.
pop: Remove coal from the top of the stack.
Above/Peek: View of the carp at the top of the Makrads without the foundation.
isEmpty: Checks if the stack is full.
Stack representation in programs:
The tread can be represented using the recommended array or list construction (linked list). In this tutorial, we'll focus on highlighting using an array.
